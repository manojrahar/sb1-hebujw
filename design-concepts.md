These design concepts offer two distinct approaches to modernizing the Lachoo Memorial College website. Design 1 maintains a more traditional academic feel with a modern twist, while Design 2 presents a more vibrant and interactive approach. Both designs prioritize user experience, clear information hierarchy, and visual appeal.

Remember, these are conceptual designs. In a real design process, you would create detailed mockups or prototypes using design software to visualize these ideas fully.
